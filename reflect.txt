	Finally, the long and last web222 final task is over. In this last task, I think the instruction made me focussed on combining all of the components of HTML, CSS, and JS as much as I can. My focus was on getting the data arranged in JavaScript. Among them, one of the most important parts was the array that stores the items and the filtering function that shows the items according to conditions. After loading all the HTML and CSS elements, the JavaScript file shows the items in the array list to the user according to the function, and the data stored in the array list according to the filtering values ​​set in real-time whenever the user presses each filtering button. Shows items filtered by value. When I made a web page this time, I tested HTML and various forms through a code editor called "Bracket" and a special function of the editor "LIVE", and through that, I was able to fix various bugs and HTML grammar errors. In fact, it wasn't hard to find the bug, but it was really hard to fix it. Finally, to summarize my experience and advice, programming, coding, and publishing don't seem to be "the end". I've been studying in advance from Korea, and I had a lot of confidence in the web, but this final task was a really difficult challenge for me. I think the best thing is to always practice steadily without being alert. In particular, it seems that I wasn't used to dealing with JavaScript, so I went through a lot of trial and error. However, during WEB222 class, all the classes were really awesome and I was satisfied. In particular, I wasn't used to dealing with JavaScript, but this lecture gave me a chance to feel that my skills have grown significantly.
